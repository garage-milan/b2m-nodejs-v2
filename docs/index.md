# Build to Manage - Node.js Observability labs

During this lab we will instrument a simple Node.js application for logging in order to use with log analytics tools like [Elastic stack](http://elastic.co) and [Humio](https://humio.com) as well as with metrics for monitoring with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com).

Instrumentation of the application code with metrics, logging and tracing is part of the general concept we call **Build to Manage**. It specifies the practice of activities developers can do in order to provide manageability aspects as part of an application release.

## Objectives
- Lab 1: Node.js logging with Winston and ELK stack
- Lab 2: Node.js logging with Winston and Humio
- Lab 3: Node.js metrics instrumentation and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Lab 4: Configure application monitoring with Prometheus on Openshift
- Distributed tracing labs

## Prerequisites
Install the following software on your workstation. You may use your laptop for all the labs, but probably a better idea is to use a clean Linux VM.
If you have access and would like to use [Fyre](https://fyre.ibm.com), I'd recommend to deploy Ubuntu 20.04 ember with 8 core CPU and 16 GB RAM (for this setup, installation of all prerequisites is as easy as
`apt install docker-compose`). 

- [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- Openshift `oc` CLI (optional)
- `curl`


Clone the following repository from GitHub.

```
git clone https://github.com/rafal-szypulka/b2m-nodejs-v2
```

Most of the commands should be executed from the `b2m-nodejs-v2/lab-x` directory:

> The solution to the lab is located in the directory b2m-nodejs-v2/lab-x/solution

> [Login to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) using `docker login` in order to avoid the problems with [recently introduced limits](https://www.openshift.com/blog/mitigate-impact-of-docker-hub-pull-request-limits).
